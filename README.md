Hey wes what settings do you use?

These are my config setting for various apps, editors and linters. I'd suggest not copying them directly but referencing what I have and what ones might make sense for you.

These are constantly changing as I work on different types of projects so I don't necessarily always have an answer to "y do u do ____ instead of ____"

Enjoy! ðŸ˜˜


## Explanations
* **Wes Bos .bttpreset** â†’ My [Better Touch Tool]() Settings. This is a collection of shortcuts and automations that I use around window management, video editing, snap areas, and much more. I will do a video on this tool one day - it's amazing.
* **settings.json** â†’ VS Code Settings
**vs-code-extensions-i-use.md** â†’ ya get?
**keybindings.json** â†’ Custom Keyboard shortcuts. The emmet Ctrl + E is how I get emmet to work anywhere.
**javascript.snippets.json** â†’ Some JS Snippets
**hot-tip-vscode-settings.json** â†’ Workspace settings I use for recording my short form content
